This is code for your project 5. Feel free to make your 
own copy of it to work with, but for any questions 
that may refer to line numbers, you should refer to the 
code in this workspace.

The AVLTree.java file contains a simple AVL tree implementation 
based on our class discussions of the AVL tree. 

The PriorityQueue_Copy.java file contains a copy of the 
PriorirytQueue class that is included in a java distribution. 
This file will not compile since its name does not match the name of 
the class. To experiment with the functionality of the PriorityQueue class
use the one from the java libraries. 
For this implementation you are responsible for the functions that we 
discussed in class: constructors, ways of adding and removing from 
a priority queue (and the functions that are called from those functions like 
heapify, siftDown, siftUp, ...). You are not responsible for understanding 
SplitIterators or functions that use Predicate classes.

The two comparator classes SringLengthComparator and AbsValComparator 
are used in the two examples that demonstrate the use of the
AVLTree class and PriorityQueue class. Some of the questions 
in the quiz may refer to these comparator classes.
